>**Some Organizational Details:** Get creative with your project ideas! Just make sure they relate to Natural Language Processing and incorporate this specified dataset: [Link to data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/webis/tldr-17), [Link to paper](https://aclanthology.org/W17-4508.pdf). Submissions should be made in teams of 2-3 students. Each team is expected to create a blog-style project website, using GitHub Pages, to present their findings. Additionally, teams will deliver a lightning talk during the final lecture to discuss their project. Add all your code, such as Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks, to the `code` folder. Use markdown files for your project report. [Here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html) you can read about how to format Markdown documents.

## Setup The Report Template

Follow this steps to set up your project report:

1. **Fork the Repository:** Begin by creating a copy of this repository for your own use. Click the `Fork` button at the top right corner of this page to do this.

2. **Configure GitHub Pages:** Navigate to `Settings` -> `Pages` in your newly forked repository. Under the `Branch` section, change from `None` to `master` and then click `Save`.

3. **Customize Configuration:** Modify the `_config.yml` file within your repository to personalize your site. Update the `title:` to reflect the title of your project and adjust the `description:` to provide a brief summary.

4. **Start Writing:** Start writing your report by modifying the `REPORT.md`. You can also add new Markdown files for additional pages by modifying the `_config.yml` file. Use the standard [GitHub Markdown syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for formatting. 

5. **Access Your Site:** Return to `Settings` -> `Pages` in your repository to find the URL to your live site. It typically takes a few minutes for GitHub Pages to build and publish your site after updates. The URL to access your live site follows this schema: `https://<<username>>.github.io/<<repository_name>>/`
